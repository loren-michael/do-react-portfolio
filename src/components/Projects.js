          <p class="text-gray-700 font-merriweather">I am a freshly certified Full Stack Engineer looking for work! During the Covid-19 pandemic, I decided to shift gears and move away from my previous career as a live sound engineer. Coding felt like a natural change for me! Between experience as an alpha tester for MMORPGs and an unofficial community leader who ran a forum with over 50,000 members and teamspeak server for years, I had an idea of what I was getting myself into.<br></br><br></br>
          
          During my career as a sound engineer, I rose to the position of Production Manager for a concert venue while also freelancing at other venues in the area. As a PM, I made sure that performers and staff were kept up to date on the schedule for the day and had all of the information needed to ensure a smooth day for everyone. This involved a lot of communication and attention to detail daily. I also was in charge of staffing a ticketing agent for most shows.<br></br><br></br>

          I love working with JavaScript and React but also have a great appreciation for Ruby on Rails. As a person who enjoys thinking logically, databases just make sense! I have a passion for accessibility and would love to find a company that prioritizes making the experience of their app as uniform as possible for all users.
